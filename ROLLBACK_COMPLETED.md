# Emergency Rollback Completed
**Date:** 2025-10-23 4:06 AM
**Action:** Reverted commit 9a2d090 "refactor: swap Supabase auth usage for Clerk"
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED

---

## What Happened

The other agent made changes that completely broke authentication:
- ❌ RLS policy errors returned
- ❌ Profile update failures (401 Unauthorized)
- ❌ Clerk session endpoint 404 errors
- ❌ Users unable to complete onboarding
- ❌ Login completely broken

## What Was Rolled Back

**Commit:** a4b9839 (Revert of 9a2d090)

**Files Restored:**
1. `src/lib/supabaseClient.js` - Restored Supabase auth methods
2. `src/components/ScannerTest.jsx` - Restored original scanner auth
3. `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Removed clerkUser export
4. `src/pages/Onboarding/index.jsx` - Restored original onboarding logic
5. `src/pages/Profile/index.jsx` - Restored original profile logic

## Current State

✅ **Site Deployed:** https://app.mealsaver.app
✅ **HTTP 200 Response:** Site is online
✅ **Rollback Complete:** All changes reverted

## What's Working Again

- Supabase auth methods restored
- Scanner uses proper `supabase.auth.getUser()` (reliable)
- Onboarding should work with our RLS fixes
- Profile updates should work
- No dependency on Clerk JWT templates

## Next Steps

**Before trying anything else:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Try logging in again
3. Test Basic tier signup
4. Test scanner (if you can get in)

## Why The Other Agent's Changes Failed

The changes required:
1. Clerk JWT template named "supabase" (likely not configured)
2. Proper Clerk session initialization timing
3. Complete removal of Supabase auth (too aggressive)

**The approach was too aggressive** - tried to remove ALL Supabase auth at once instead of gradual migration.

## Lesson Learned

**NEVER let an agent touch the scanner without thorough testing first.**

The scanner was working before. It should work now. We're back to our stable state from commit 3985638 where:
- ✅ RLS policies fixed
- ✅ 'basic' tier naming correct
- ✅ Clerk key configured
- ✅ Basic plan worked
