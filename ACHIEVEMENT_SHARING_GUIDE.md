      badge={badge}
      userName={user?.email?.split('@')[0]}
      onShare={handleBadgeShare}
    />
    <BadgeImageGenerator

      userName={user?.email?.split('@')[0]}
      onGenerate={handleImageGenerate}
    />
  </div>
)}
```

### Analytics Tracking

Both components include callback functions for tracking:

```javascript
const handleBadgeShare = (badge) => {
  console.log('Badge shared:', badge.name)
  // Add analytics tracking here
  // e.g., track event to Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.
}

const handleImageGenerate = (badge) => {

}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Share Menu Not Opening

- Clear browser cache

### Social Platform Opens but Doesn't Share
- Ensure you're logged into the platform
- Check popup blocker settings
- Try a different browser
- Use "Copy Link" as alternative

### Copy to Clipboard Fails
- Grant clipboard permissions
- Try fallback (manual copy from text area)
- Check browser compatibility
- Use native share instead

### Image Not Downloading
- Check browser download settings
- Look in Downloads folder
- Try a different browser
- Check file permissions

### Image Quality Issues
- Images are 1200x630px PNG format
- Should look crisp on all devices
- May appear large on small screens
- Scale down if needed for stories

### Native Share Not Available
- Native share requires HTTPS or localhost
