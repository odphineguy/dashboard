## ü§î "But won't this break my app?"

**Answer:** It depends on whether you're using Apple Sign In.

### If you're NOT using Apple Sign In yet:
‚úÖ **Nothing will break** - just revoke the keys. Done!

### If you ARE using Apple Sign In in production:
You'll need to create NEW keys and update Supabase. Here's how:

#### Create New Key:
1. Still in Apple Developer Console, click the **"+"** button
2. Name it: "Apple Sign In Key"
3. Check the box next to **"Sign In with Apple"**
4. Click **"Continue"** then **"Register"**
5. Click **"Download"** (you can only do this once!)
6. Save the `.p8` file somewhere safe on your computer

#### Generate New JWT Token:
```bash
# In your dashboard folder
cp generate-apple-jwt.template.js generate-apple-jwt.js
```

Then open `generate-apple-jwt.js` in any text editor and replace:
- `YOUR_TEAM_ID` with your Apple Team ID
- `YOUR_KEY_ID` with the Key ID of the new key you just created
- `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your Services ID
- `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENT_HERE` with the content from the `.p8` file

Then run:
```bash
node generate-apple-jwt.js
```

Copy the token it prints out.

#### Update Supabase:
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Providers** ‚Üí **Apple**
4. Paste the new JWT token in the **"Secret Key"** field
5. Click **"Save"**

Done! ‚úÖ
