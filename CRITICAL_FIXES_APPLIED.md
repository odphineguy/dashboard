# Critical Fixes Applied - Clerk & Stripe Integration

## Date: 2025-10-22

This document summarizes the critical security and data integrity fixes applied to the Clerk-Stripe integration before deployment.

---

## ✅ All Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Fixed Stripe Webhook Error Handling Vulnerability
**File:** `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`

**Problem:** Request body was being read twice - once for signature verification and again in error handler, causing errors to fail silently.

**Fix:**
- Stored `eventId` in variable before processing
- Updated error handler to use stored `eventId` instead of attempting to read body again
- Error logging now works correctly without consuming request stream twice

**Impact:** Webhook errors are now properly logged to database for debugging.

---

### 2. Fixed Profile Creation Race Condition
**File:** `supabase/functions/create-checkout-session/index.ts`

**Problem:** Edge function attempted to create profile if not found, but Clerk webhook should have already created it. This created race conditions where:
1. User signs up via Clerk
2. User immediately clicks "Subscribe"
3. Checkout session is called before Clerk webhook fires
4. Profile is created with incomplete data

**Fix:**
- Removed fallback profile creation logic
- Implemented retry mechanism (3 attempts with 1-second delays)
- Returns clear error message if profile not ready after retries
- Forces proper webhook-first flow

**Impact:** Eliminates duplicate profile attempts and ensures data consistency.

---

### 3. Fixed Account Takeover Vulnerability
**File:** `supabase/functions/clerk-webhook/index.ts`

**Problem:** Webhook created profiles using `upsert` with Clerk user ID without validating if email already exists. Attack vector:
1. Attacker creates Clerk account with victim's email
2. Webhook fires and creates profile with attacker's Clerk ID
3. Victim loses access to their data if they already had an account

**Fix:**
- Added email existence check before profile creation
- Returns 409 Conflict if email already registered with different user ID
- Logs security events for monitoring

**Impact:** Prevents account takeover attacks via email collision.

---

### 4. Added Input Validation to SQL SECURITY DEFINER Functions
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251022000000_clerk_compatibility.sql`

**Problem:** All database functions using `SECURITY DEFINER` lacked input validation, creating potential security risks.

**Fixes Applied:**
- `get_user_subscription()` - Validates user_id (not null, not empty, max 100 chars)
- `has_feature_access()` - Validates user_id and feature (length and format checks)
- `get_subscription_limits()` - Validates user_id parameter
- `can_add_pantry_item()` - Validates user_id parameter

**Impact:** Prevents malformed inputs from reaching database functions.

---

### 5. Fixed Missing Default Storage Locations for Clerk Users
**File:** `supabase/functions/clerk-webhook/index.ts`

**Problem:** New Clerk users didn't receive default storage locations (Pantry, Refrigerator, Freezer), breaking core functionality.

**Fix:**
- Added storage location creation in `user.created` webhook handler
- Creates 3 default locations: Pantry, Refrigerator, Freezer
- Logs errors if creation fails without blocking profile creation

**Impact:** New users can immediately start using the app without manual setup.

---

### 6. Fixed CASCADE DELETE to Prevent Data Loss
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251022000000_clerk_compatibility.sql`

**Problem:** Billing tables (`subscriptions`, `payment_history`) used `ON DELETE CASCADE`, causing:
- Permanent loss of billing records when user deleted
- Compliance violations (payment records must be retained)
- No audit trail for deleted user subscriptions

**Fixes:**
```sql
-- Subscriptions table
ALTER TABLE subscriptions
ALTER COLUMN user_id DROP NOT NULL;

FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Payment history table
ALTER TABLE payment_history
ALTER COLUMN user_id DROP NOT NULL;

FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

**Impact:**
- Billing records preserved for compliance
- Audit trail maintained for deleted users
- Meets financial record retention requirements

---

### 7. Added Missing Foreign Key Constraint on household_id
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251022000000_clerk_compatibility.sql`

**Problem:** `pantry_items.household_id` had no foreign key constraint, allowing:
- Orphaned pantry items referencing non-existent households
- Data corruption when households deleted
- Invalid references in database

**Fix:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE pantry_items
ADD CONSTRAINT pantry_items_household_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (household_id) REFERENCES households(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

**Impact:**
- Prevents orphaned pantry items
- Items become personal (household_id = NULL) when household deleted
- Maintains data integrity

---

### 8. Fixed Stripe Subscription Orphaning on User Deletion
**File:** `supabase/functions/clerk-webhook/index.ts`

**Problem:** When users deleted their Clerk account, Stripe subscriptions remained active, causing:
- Continued billing after account deletion
- Orphaned subscriptions in Stripe
- Customer service issues

**Fix:**
- Added Stripe subscription cancellation in `user.deleted` webhook handler
- Retrieves all active/trialing/past_due subscriptions
- Cancels each subscription in Stripe before profile deletion
- Logs cancellation events and errors

**Impact:**
- No orphaned subscriptions
- Users stop being charged immediately upon deletion
- Clean subscription lifecycle

---

### 9. Added Webhook Idempotency
**File:** `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`

**Problem:** Webhook could process same event multiple times if Stripe retried, causing:
- Duplicate subscription updates
- Inconsistent database state
- Double payment processing

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Check if event already processed
const { data: existingEvent } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('stripe_webhooks_log')
  .select('processed')
  .eq('event_id', event.id)
  .single()

if (existingEvent?.processed) {
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ received: true, status: 'already_processed' }), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    status: 200,
  })
}
```

**Impact:**
- Safe webhook retry handling
- Prevents duplicate processing
- Idempotent webhook operations

---

## Additional Improvements

### Subscription Tier Standardization
- Removed 'free' tier references
- Standardized on 'basic' tier across all code
- Updated `get_subscription_limits()` default from 'free' to 'basic'

---

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, test:

- [ ] New user signup creates profile with default storage locations
- [ ] Subscription payment flow completes successfully
- [ ] Webhook retries don't cause duplicate processing
- [ ] User deletion cancels active Stripe subscriptions
- [ ] Deleted user billing records remain in database (user_id = NULL)
- [ ] Profile creation waits for Clerk webhook (retry logic)
- [ ] Email collision returns 409 error (security test)
- [ ] SQL functions reject invalid inputs (null, empty, oversized)
- [ ] Household deletion sets pantry_items.household_id to NULL

---

## Deployment Steps

1. **Set Secrets:**
```bash
supabase secrets set CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
supabase secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
```

2. **Run Migration:**
```bash
supabase db push
```

3. **Deploy Edge Functions:**
```bash
supabase functions deploy clerk-webhook --no-verify-jwt
supabase functions deploy create-checkout-session
supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook
```

4. **Configure Webhooks:**
- Clerk Dashboard → Webhooks → Add endpoint with edge function URL
- Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks → Add endpoint with edge function URL
